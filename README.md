# Review CS10 Music Player
Review of GUI by creating GUI Music Player Pop-Up

# Description
- [ ] Reivew Code for Basic Music Player: copy and paste working program into new Processing.org
- [ ] Review Image Aspect Algorithm and Design Options
- [ ] Review Text and Font Size Calculator
- [ ] Review Procedures: writing code once to be repeated
  - Create Subprograms for Images, Text, and 2D Shapes
    - Emphasize variations of ```Global Variables```, ```void setup()```,```void draw()```, ```void keyPressed()```, ```void mousePressed()```
    - Then create proceudres that access these specific to the subprogram
  - Create MISC Subprogram that repeats code separate from above
    - Ex. println function that inspects variable for debugging, println("Here", variable);
    - Ex. println function repeating specific varaible inspection and concatenation
- [ ] Review DIVs and variables: creating more abstract image, text, and 2D image algorithms
  Note: DISPLAY GEOMETRY mimics DIV, thus entire music player can become an object with procedures (all code and API written as these metaphors)
- [ ] Review Music Player KeyBoard Buttons as functions then ...
- [ ] Complete a Case Study to visualize what the Music Player Pop-up will be like
- [ ] This will include preferences like fast-forward-rewind time, dark mode, light mode, and night mode
- [ ] Finish by using real and non-real time calcualtions in exporting a file with efficiency data as a subprogram and procuedres to be run
- [ ] Advanced: write the music player as a object with an encapsualted class

Next Button Demonstrated
- keyPressed() will demonstrate individual functions controlled by keyboard
- Note: functions will be procedures at CS20 Level
- CS20 Intro Project Review GUI, connects to Flowchart, & redesigns for SMART GUI
